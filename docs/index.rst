You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
contain the root `toctree` directive.

pyLIMA 
======

pyLIMA is the first microlensing analysis open-source software, primarly designed to 
fit real data. But more can be done, see the :ref:`examples`. You can find more information
on the `pyLIMA paper(s) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08704>`_.

You probably need to start with the :ref:`installation` step and then run some :ref:`examples`.
You can also have a look to pyLIMA's :ref:`conventions`.
