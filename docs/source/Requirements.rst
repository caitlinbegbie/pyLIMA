Requirements
============

pyLIMA is an open-source project developed through the GitHub system. To download/update the code, please intall git on your machine :

`git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ ; `here <https://guides.github.com/>`_ is a guide to the git system.

pyLIMA is based on several libraries. Some of them need :

a fortran compiler and a C/C++ compiler, such as gfortran and gcc/g++. For example, you can do this in Ubuntu

**> sudo apt-get install gfortran**

**> sudo apt-get install gcc** 


We gonna need a package manager, such as `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ or `anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ (not fully tested).
